# Simple responsive javascript project

## The project is responsive thanks to bootstrap grid and flex system

## If we want to execute some codes for tags that could be changed, deleted, updated or even added (eg: todo list in this example), we better to run our executable on the parents tags (in this example our object is 'todo-object' and parent is 'todo-list' so when we want to do something to 'todo-objects' we execute the needed code on the 'object-list'. Just look at "Delete Todo object" section.)

### In bootstrap, there is a little diffrence between 'd-flex' and 'row' classes. Both used to create flex block

### In bootstrap, to use 'col-xxx' system, we don't have to use 'row' or 'd-flex'. 'col-xxx' system is a independent and very powerful system to create responsive web pages for diffrent screen with diffrent sizes. But this system could be used with grid and flex system and create very responsive web pages
